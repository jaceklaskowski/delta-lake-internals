# Post-Commit Hooks

[PostCommitHook](PostCommitHook.md)s are actions to be [executed](../OptimisticTransactionImpl.md#runPostCommitHooks) right after a successful [transaction commit](../OptimisticTransactionImpl.md#commit).

Post-Commit Hooks can be registered using [registerPostCommitHook](../OptimisticTransactionImpl.md#registerPostCommitHook).
